# ADR-002: React Fundamentals & TypeScript Integration

## Status
[ACCEPTED ]

## Context
[Applying Component Based Architecture. Created expense forms, made expeneses mandatory, and improved css styling]

**Requirements:**
- Catch errors early in development
- Improve code maintainability
- Support team collaboration
- Prepare students for industry standards

**Options considered:**
1. **JavaScript**: Familiar, quick to start, flexible
2. **TypeScript**: Type safety, better tooling, industry standard
3. **React**: User interface is a function of application's state

## Decision
We will use React for all new code in this project.

**Rationale:**
- Prevents common runtime errors through compile-time checking
- Improves IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- Industry standard at 78% of companies according to State of JS 2024
- Better documentation through type definitions

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code through type definitions
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Industry-relevant skill development

**Negative:**
- Initial learning curve for team members unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Additional build complexity compared to plain JavaScript
- Slightly longer development time for simple features
- Need to learn type definitions for third-party libraries

**Mitigation:**
- Start with basic TypeScript features and gradually adopt advanced patterns
- Provide TypeScript resources and support during team learning
- Use `any` type sparingly for quick prototyping when needed
